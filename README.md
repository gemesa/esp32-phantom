# esp32-phantom

:warning: Work in progress! :warning:

esp32-phantom is a Rust sandbox to explore the Wi-Fi and BLE capabilities of the ESP32, for example:
- Wi-Fi monitoring
- promiscuous mode
- pcap logging
- crypto price monitoring

If you are serious about security analysis/pen testing I suggest to use an Alfa adapter instead such as [AWUS036AXML](https://alfa-network.eu/alfa-usb-adapter-awus036axml) or [AWUS036ACHM](https://alfa-network.eu/awus036achm) in combination with [hcxdumptool](https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxdumptool). Both of them are supported with excellent in-kernel drivers.
